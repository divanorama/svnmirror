These dirty scripts automate svnsync from remote repo to a local file:// repo.

Initial setup:
edit cfg.sh - set path prefix for data
./init_repo.sh NAME URL
./do_sync_svn.sh NAME

Cronjob or whatever:
./do_sync_svn.sh NAME

Features:
- ./init_repo.sh creates local repo with a pre-revprop-change hook.
- ./svnsync_hack.sh reruns svnsync if it has fetched something and then crashed
  usually it happens on long syncs if a connection is suddenly lost.
- ./unlock_svn_repo.sh NAME can help if sync crashed badly, removes svn:sync-lock from r0.

Known bugs:
- svnsync fails to fetch log message/author in broken utf8(like cp1251 with accent characters),
  so if repo(like svn://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source@136746) has it scripts won't sync past them.
